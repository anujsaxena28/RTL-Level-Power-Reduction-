Clock Gating
Clock Gating is one of the most frequently used techniques in RTL to reduce dynamic power consumption. It provides a way to selectively stop the clock and thus force the original circuit to make no transition, whenever the computation that is to be carried out at the next clock cycle is redundant. In simpler terms, the clock is disabled according to the idle conditions of the logic network. For reactive circuits, the number of clock cycles in which the design is idle in some wait states is usually large. Therefore, avoiding power waste corresponding to such states may be significant. 
The logic for the clock management is automatically synthesized from the Boolean function that represents the idle conditions of the circuit. It may well be the case that considering all conditions results in additional circuitry that is too large and too power consuming. It may then be necessary to synthesize a simplified function, which dissipates the minimum possible power and stops the clock with maximum efficiency. The use of gated clocks has the drawback that the logic implementing the clock gating mechanism is functionally redundant, and this may create major difficulties in testing and verification.
 
Another difficulty with clock-gating is that one must prevent hazards/glitches on the EN signal from corrupting the clock signal to the register sets. This can be accomplished by introducing a transparent latch between EN and the AND gate as shown in the figure below.

IV.	Optimal Customized Clock Gating
1)	Clock Gating for 1bit registers (CCG_1Bit_DC_EX_gen.v) 
In this step clock gating is applied to only the 1-bit registers. Formal verification is done to establish the legitimacy of the design. The following screenshot shows the result for formal verification done using formality.

i)	Power Estimation
Cell Internal Power = 2.9653 mW
Net Switching Power = 114.1721 uW
Total Dynamic Power = 3.0794 mW
Cell Leakage Power = 127.3181 uW
Total Power Consumption= Total Dynamic power + Cell Leakage Power 
 = 3.0794 + 0.1273181
 = 3.2067 mW
ii)	Area
Total Combinational area = 12365.1161 nm2
Non-Combinational area = 6334.1422 nm2
Total Cell Area =18699.2583 nm2
iii)	Timing 
Data Required Time= 9.90ns
Data Arrival Time = 2.71 ns
Slack Time = 7.19 ns
Observation: Implementation of clock gating for only 1-bit registers doesn’t help reduce the power consumption from the original design. There is also a significant area overhead attached with respect to the size of the register. 

2)	Clock Gating for 8-bit registers (CCG_8Bit_DC_EX_gen.v)
In this step clock gating is applied to only the 8-bit registers. Formal verification is done to establish the legitimacy of the design. The following screenshot shows the result for formal verification done using formality.

i)	Power Estimation
Cell Internal Power = 3.0540 mW
Net Switching Power = 117.9359 uW
Total Dynamic Power = 3.1719 mW
Cell Leakage Power = 124.8888 uW
Total Power Consumption= Total Dynamic power + Cell Leakage Power 
 = 3.1719 + 0.1248888 
 = 3.2968 mW
ii)	Area
Total Combinational area = 12152.5232 nm2
Non-Combinational area = 6354.7914 nm2
Total Cell Area =18507.3146 nm2
iii)	Timing 
Data Required Time= 9.90ns
Data Arrival Time = 2.52 ns
Slack Time = 7.38 ns
Observation: Clock gating scheme for only 8-bit registers doesn’t do well enough in saving power when compared to the original design. There is also a significant area overhead associated with this implementation. 

3)	Clock Gating for 32-bit registers (CCG_32Bit_DC_EX_gen.v)
In this step clock gating is applied to only the 32-bit registers. Formal verification is done to establish the legitimacy of the design. The following screenshot shows the result for formal verification done using formality. 
 

 




There were 16 32-bit registers which were modified to implement clock gating. The RTL design was synthesized for power, area, timing estimation using Power Compiler. The results are listed below: 
i)	Power Estimation
Cell Internal Power = 2.271 mW
Net Switching Power = 117.3584 uW
Total Dynamic Power = 2.3895 mW
Cell Leakage Power = 117.3696 uW
Total Power Consumption= Total Dynamic power + Cell Leakage Power 
 = 2.3895 + 0.1173696
 = 2.5069 mW
ii)	Area
Total Combinational area = 10150.4894 nm2
Non-Combinational area = 6365.1160 nm2
Total Cell Area =16515.6054 nm2
iii)	Timing 
Data Required Time= 9.90ns
Data Arrival Time = 1.49 ns
Slack Time = 8.41 ns
Observation: The power optimization level reached is high as the dynamic power saved by clock gating the 32-bit registers is large. The dynamic power consumption in 32-bit registers is more because of the high switching activity of large number of bits as compared to a 1-bit or an 8-bit register. The chip area consumed is also optimized in comparison to the original design. 

4)	 Optimized Design (CCG_FINAL_DC_EX_gen.v)  
The clock gating power reduction scheme was implemented for the 3 types of registers in combinations of 2 to determine the optimal design for low power. It was determined through logic synthesis of the design that the combination of clock gating for 8Bit and 32Bit registers yielded the least power and area. 
The formal verification output is shown in the screenshots below. 
 
 
The power, area, timing results for the above specified design implementation is listed below: 
i)	Power Estimation
Cell Internal Power = 2.1924 mW
Net Switching Power = 137.6712 uW
Total Dynamic Power = 2.3301 mW
Cell Leakage Power = 116.7943 uW
Total Power Consumption= Total Dynamic power + Cell Leakage Power 
 = 2.3301 + 0.1167943
 = 2.4469 mW

ii)	Area
Total Combinational area = 9940.7123 nm2
Non-Combinational area = 6406.4144 nm2
Total Cell Area =16347.1267 nm2
iii)	Timing 
Data Required Time= 9.90ns
Data Arrival Time = 1.70 ns
Slack Time = 8.20 ns
Observation:
It is observed that the clock gating design for 8Bit and 32Bit registers is the most efficient in terms of power since the clock gating design minimises the unwanted clock transitions when the circuit is idle thereby reducing the dynamic power. The bus width plays an important role in determining the overall activity factor. Hence for large registers/buses the dynamic power consumption is also huge. Therefore, it makes sense to implement clock gating for large buses/registers rather than small registers which suffer from clock gating area overhead.
